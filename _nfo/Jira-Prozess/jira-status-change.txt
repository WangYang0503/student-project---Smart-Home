nfo from 25.08.2016 meeting:
test task is for external sidekick (=sth. like QA) who checks user story to log work
doku task is for doku writer to log work, gets infos from dev (=assignee of task)
task needs not to be in every state during its lifetime
assignee of user story = sidekick for tasks within it
