add maven to path

set JAVA_HOME variable to your java installation if needed

set ANDROID_HOME to your android sdk path (usually in %AppData%)


ignore prerequisites in readme files, instead do this:
- do as readme.md in riot root directory says until line 37
- do as readme.md in server subdirectory says
- add git to path of the correct user (admin / your user) if needed (bower fails with "git not in path")
- do as readme.md in webapp subdirectory says in lines 63-64 (bower has to load a lot of stuff); probably optional, as run in every maven build

settings.xml needs to be created in %userfolder%/.m2/settings.xml

maven import all RIOT projects into eclipse

replace pom.xml in RIOT root with the modified version from here
